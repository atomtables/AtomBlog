    content: `
            So hello there! This is my first article on this blog. It's been a long time as well. I think during French
            class in 8th grade I started working on the design for this website. There's been so much I've learnt since
            then. I couldn't even begin to list the events that happened in the last 3 years.
            <br><br>
            The most important thing I learnt, something that'll stick with me forever (I hope), is that you never
            achieve perfection on the first try. Some of the reasons why this website took so long is because I was so
            obsessed with perfecting the exact design of this page. But you can only really learn from your mistakes
            if you aren't afraid to make them.
            <br><br>
            This website was originally going to be a full-stack website with every damn feature known to mankind 3
            years ago. But through the process of trying, failing, (procrastinating for months on end), and doing some
            research, I tempered my visions with a large dose of reality.
            <br><br>
            It wasn't until Hack Club did an event that I had the motivation to finish this website. At that point, I was
            concerned with looks but not perfection. I wanted to push something, to send out some sort of product. It wasn't
            by any means my best work, but it was a work I was able to push out there and get some feedback on. I used
            that feedback to make the website better, and used the rewards from that event to buy a domain.
            <br><br>
            Coming back to the point though, if you aim for something unrealistic, you'll land in development hell. When
            you set a realistic goal to push something you're proud of, you'll have a product that others can judge and
            give you feedback on. You'll have a product you yourself can introspect and change if you need to.
            <br><br>
            I hope to work on a lot of stuff in the coming future, and I hope for this blog to document all of it.
            And I hope you, the reader, enjoy the random introspections. Probably not this article, but all the others.

    description: "I had a talk with a friend about the different intricacies that turned music into sugar for the ears, " + "and I really just had to write about the beauty of it all.",
    date: new Date(2025, 2-1, 16),
    content: `
            I'm a Tamilian, so naturally I listen to a lot of Tamil music. Unfortunately, where I live, there aren't a
            whole lot of Tamil people, and out of those Tamil people, there's even less that actually listen to Tamil
            music. Luckily, music transcends language. When you hear exceptionally well-made songs, every piece of the
            music stack comes together. The lyrics and the tune of the music come together to create sugar. And for
            people that don't understand the lyrics, the tune still has a real significance.
            <br><br>
            One such song is "Thuli Thuli" from "Paiya". You might not know this song, but you can find it online.
            You can see this during the chorus of the song. To understand it's impact, you have to understand the impact
            of the treble and bass on our emotions.
            <br><br>
            You hear bass in a lot of songs. It's especially useful in "feeling" words. Most of where the melody lies
            is in the middle of the music range, so outliers like bass add to the song without crowding the mid-area any
            more than it currently is.
            <br><br>
            What you may not notice as much, or at least I haven't, is that treble is used in this same manner. Higher
            notes that aren't in the vocal range can be as effective in "feeling" the music as bass can. And this is
            exactly what "Thuli Thuli" uses in the chorus.
            <br><br>
            The actual lyrics say (translated):
            <blockquote>
                "Go, go, go to her / my legs tell me to / Say, say, say to her / my heart begs me to"
            </blockquote>
            It's rhyme and effect are better in Tamil, but this will do. Compared to the first verse, the chorus includes
            a bassline and a widened instrument range in the mids (I think it's a piano playing two-sets of interval chords
            and a violin playing broken chords, but I might be wrong). But most importantly, on the second and fourth line,
            there's a treble synth of some sort that echoes throughout the line. The effect of that simple synth is a lot.
            It differentiates the line from the first and third, it adds a sense of intent to those lines. Combined with
            the lyrics (in Tamil), they make you feel like the character in this song has lost control, that he's going to
            go to her and tell her everything.
            <br><br>
            It has a lot of effect in the slightly faster and slightly higher-pitched video version as well, if not more.
            Yuvan Shankar Raja, the composer of this movie's songs, did very well in its creation. While the big picture
            of a song matters, so do the small details. This single high note played in the treble had this big of
            an effect on the feeling of the song.
            <br><br>
            There's also another song by Anirudh Ravichander: "Un Vizhigalil" from "Maan Karate". The beginning and the
            end of the song have the same lyrics. You can find them online, and I recommend listening to the entirety of
            the song. While the beginning and the end (only) have the same lyrics, the beat massively changes in between
            them.
            <br><br>
            This beat change is more than just more drums and some bassline and some violin all shuffled everywhere. The
            entirety of the song builds up to a point. The song's meaning is about a guy expressing his desire to remain
            with the girl he likes. And it builds up to that point.
            <br><br>
            The beginning of the song is very basic. There's nothing more than a little bit of synth echo and the vocals.
            The violin then comes in for a solo, creating the theme of the melody of the song. A small guitar accompaniment
            and vocal part follow, and the chorus section comes. The chorus increases in speed, with a stronger guitar
            accompaniment, a treble voice echo, and the "radio-like" repeating of words. Drums, the same violin tune, and
            a new guitar riff come to the midsection of the song. It later continues with a duet with the girl and the boy,
            the music continuing to intensity throughout the rest of the song. By the time the end comes, the lyrics stay
            the same but <b>the song has a completely different outlook</b>.
            <br><br>
            It goes from a solo from a guy who wants to stay with the girl he likes to a duet with a guy and a girl's love
            for each other welded together. The echo of the voices, the "radio-like" effects, the stereo-sound of each voice,
            it all has its own individual effect to create sweetness in the ears. You'd have to listen to the song to
            really get all these points, preferably with headphones to capture the intricacies, but it's all there. The
            smallest of effects to the music, the vocals, create such a difference in the feeling the song leaves you. The
            ending of the song is somewhat incomplete, as in it doesn't end with every instrument slowly coming to an end.
            The violin leaves one last movement before the song ends, as if the song is still playing elsewhere, and we've come
            to the end of our own listening session. It gives a feeling that the love these two share is going to stay.
            <br><br>
            All this is just for 2 songs as well. You could write so much more about just one of these songs, and imagine
            all the different songs out there in the world, each with embedded intricacies that all mix and merge together
            so well. The main tune, the main concept of a song matters as well. You can't really have a beautiful song if
            you just mash random notes. And you can have extremely basic songs with not a whole lot of intricacies that
            can still remain beautiful. But the exceptional songs, ones that are universally understood and felt without
            a language barrier, are songs that add the smallest changes, notes, and effects to really put someone in that
            feeling.
            <br><br>
            That's the beauty of music.

    title: "Our FRC Team 10600 Gets Nominated for Rookie All-Star: What an experience",
    description: "My first time at an FRC event, and our team's performance at the event.",
    date: new Date(2025, 3-1, 10),
    content: `
        <img src="/frcatmohscomprookie/image1.JPG" alt="10600's robot">
        <br>
        Now's a good time to mention I haven't really dabbled in robotics. I've heard of it, as most people would have,
        but I haven't had much of a chance to interact with robots or play around in a robotics competition. This year,
        I had that chance. The team I am a lead of, team 10600, participated in the Mount Olive FMA event, and we were
        nominated for Rookie All-Star. In my opinion, the best part was meeting all these new people, and seeing people
        work on their robot in real time. It was unlike an experience I've ever had before.
        <br><br>
        As a rookie team, and especially as a community team, we've struggled with a lot of things. We don't have any
        school-backed funds, and getting sponsorships to sponsor the remaining cost of our build was a struggle. We
        were still able to make it though, and we entered Mount Olive with... a robot. Now obviously, our robot
        wasn't the cream of the crop. It had its fair share of issues. But just getting to a real competition for the
        first time, with a robot that would compete with everyone else, was a feeling within itself.
        <br><br>
        <img src="/frcatmohscomprookie/image3.JPG" alt="10600 working on their robot">
        <br>
        Our robot didn't perform the best during the competition. We had a couple of issues, most of which manifested from
        our inability to be able to continuously test modifications to our robot. We didn't have the name "Two Steps Ahead"
        for nothing though, and we persevered through every obstacle that came our way. When an issue arised, our pit crew
        got to work fixing it. If a wire came loose, we reinforced it. If our auto went the wrong way, we modified it.
        When our algae arms were causing issues, we made the best of our situation and disabled them with zipties.
        <br><br>
        While we weren't able to make it into playoffs this time around, I don't doubt that our team will continue
        to improve on our robot's design in the two weeks we have until our next competition. We are, after all, "always
        ahead, always advancing." We come up with solutions for every problem that sticks in our way, and we will
        come back next competition with a better, stronger, robot.
        <br><br>
        <img src="/frcatmohscomprookie/image2.JPG" alt="10600 and the field">
        <br>
        The best part of the competition, in my <i>humble</i> opinion, was the people. Never have I ever before met this
        many people at an event. Never have I ever SEEN this many people in an event. This was my first time in an FRC
        event, and I met so many people from so many teams. Our team went around and collected pins from neighbouring
        teams, and we all showed so much support to and from each other.
        <br><br>
        In fact, that's one of the best things about FRC in general. Since before the season started, our team has been
        able to gather so much help, from teams like 1676 Pascack Pi-oneers, or 555 Montclair Robotics, or all of the
        other teams that have been able to provide us with information to a practice field.
        <br><br>
        Being in FRC is like being in a knit community, where everyone shares a cool common interest and works to
        further their passion. In FRC, people don't just build to improve their team, they offer to help others. I'd like
        to personally thank the two programmers that came to our pit to help us out with our auto, you guys were so good
        and saved us! Such a community really is so cool to see.

    title: "AtomStudies: FBLA NJSLC Mobile App Development 2025 Podium",
    description: "How I won 4th place in the FBLA NJSLC Mobile App Development 2025 competition.",
    date: new Date(2025, 3-1, 16),
    content: `
        From 10 to 12 March 2025, New Jersey's FBLA organisation held the State Leadership Conference. During this
        period, I participated and placed in the top 4 in the Mobile App Development competition, qualifying for
        nationals. For this competition, I created an app called "AtomStudies", a chemistry study app that helps
        students with their chemistry studies.
        <br><br>
        <h2>What was the inspiration behind this app?</h2>
        My online username is "atomtables", and I have a tendency to overuse my name when it comes to products. When 
        originally planning this app, I named the app "AtomStudies" as I normally would (the atom blog comes to mind). 
        Then it hit me: I'm taking AP Chemistry right now, and it would make a ton of sense, given the name of the app,
        to make AtomStudies an app that assists with studying for Chemistry.
        <br><br>
        When originally looking at the rubric for the app, I almost panicked, because I thought the rubric wanted an 
        app that taught its users MANY things, like a general learning app. When going to my maths teacher for advice,
        she pointed out that I could focus the app on a specific topic, which would help make the content, the curriculum,
        and the structure more specific and more tailored.
        <br><br>
        <h2>How did I build the app?</h2>
        Since the category I was competing in was called "Mobile App Development", it was obvious my app had to be tailored
        towards a phone. Surprisingly, the rubric included the option for making a Windows Phone app, which I was actually
        thinking about doing. In the end, I settled for making a SwiftUI app. I already have experience with the iPhone-based
        platform.
        <br><br>
        For database storage, I only saw one really good option: Firebase. Firebase already has good integration with
        iOS+ apps, and taking advantage of the authentication and database features Firebase has would provide enough
        backend for my app to need. Firebase wouldn't really make that much of a difference anyway, mainly because 
        of the next part.
        <br><br>
        <h2>The disaster that was development</h2>
        I originally started working on AtomStudies around January, although not making strides of progress until February.
        This was due to horrible circumstances, as well as horrible planning on my part. It's hard to admit, but I
        definitely did not plan out a good development schedule. Between schoolwork, grades, and the ending of the
        marking period nearing late January and early February, I lost a lot of development time studying for tests and
        finishing up homework. Near mid-February, I wanted to ask my AP Chem teacher for some help on creating the curriculum
        for this app, but due to extenuating circumstances, he had to take leave from school and was not very available
        for that week.
        <br><br>
        The date was now around 20 February. The competition was on 10 March. I had around 3 weeks to not only finish
        the entire app, which was currently incomplete besides the preliminary sketches in my journal, but also to
        finish the presentation, prepare the app for testing by judges, practice the presentation, and make sure that
        Firebase works with limited internet.
        <br><br>
        Friends know how dedicated I was to the FBLA grind. The weeks leading up to FBLA, I would be on Xcode, coding
        during lunch, coding in the library, coding while recovering from a fractured wrist, coding while eating, and
        coding in between the 4 minutes we get for passing. I started seeing Xcode in my dreams, almost like a
        pseudo-Vision-Pro that would only ever produce compile errors. The days before FBLA was our rookie team's first
        FRC competition at Mount Olive, and while we spectated on the stands, I was still grinding for FBLA. For those
        20 days, I breathed code. 
        <br><br>
        Due to the horrible time constraints I had, I couldn't develop the most sophisticated curriculum. The solution
        I ended up taking was a friend's solution, who suggested I use online resources to create a "curriculum", or 
        something that would serve to act as placeholder content. The app's content didn't need to be the most descriptive,
        because, in his words, "you're just a high schooler / you don't need the best content or whatever just show the
        app / it's mobile app development not curriculum development". 
        <br><br>
        The curriculum ended up being completely hardcoded into the app's code. This was for two reasons. The internet
        at the hotel was unreliable, and it wouldn't be known whether I would be able to load Firestore content at the
        presentation room. It would also be time consuming to get arrays and arrays of data into Firebase. Even for
        just one unit, there was a lot of content, and Firebase was not the most reliable way of storing all of that
        content. 
        <br><br>
        Also due to the horrible time constraints I had, a lot of the app's UI code, especially anything that shows
        lessons, is hardcoded to assume only one unit will ever exist. In fact, a lot of the UI's presentation variables
        are compiled into the app and reset on every launch. Due to a prioritisation mismatch, I spent too much time on
        certain aspects of the app that wouldn't matter to a panel of judges and didn't spend enough time on the actual
        presentational aspects.
        <br><br>
        The slideshow, however, was a significant step up. The content included a lot of my original work on the app, such
        as the original design sketches, planning for the app's data storage, and detailed explanations on the function
        of the app and how it (theoretically) can serve as a great resource.
        <br><br>
        <h2>So obviously, there was a lot to learn</h2>
        If you think I'm being tough, I'm not. There really was a lot left to learn.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Keep your priorities straight.</b> This app taught me that when you're on a time crunch, you have to
                spend your limited time on the tasks that actually make a difference. A nice subclass for initialising
                Firebase might be cool, but a functioning app is cooler.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Get a headstart.</b> Time is always limited, and you never know when you'll either be busy or when
                you'll be unable to get tasks done. The more you can get done while you have time, the less you'll have 
                to do when the going gets tough.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Maintain higher quality code.</b> Looking at the codebase, the quality of code I have written makes
                me ashamed to even have it posted on Github. It made it harder to work on the code as well, and in some
                cases, I wrote some nonsense code that doesn't use the app's data properly.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h2>I mean, there were results though</h2>
        Even though the app might have sucked on the backend (or the end that only I would see), the app's interface
        and user-friendliness was pretty good. After all, the FBLA competition judged my app on its presentation, 
        not the horribly-written backend. My presentation was high quality, and I was able to present with very little
        hiccups. The judges interacted with my app throughout the presentation, going through submenus and finding the
        important screens.
        <br><br>
        The quality of my presentation helped me in 4th place, placing in the "podium" for the event and helping me
        qualify for nationals. While I am unable to go to nationals due to scheduling conflicts, I am very excited to
        go on next year. hopefully with a higher quality app and better planning beforehand.

    description: "Yes, the name's ripped off from the Blue Alliance, but I promise you it's a completely different app that will really help teams out",
    date: new Date(2025, 4-1, 17),
    content: `
        A problem our FRC team has faced, being a community team, is coordination. It's really hard to plan out meetings,
        carpooling, attendance, and tasks when your team is 1. severely over-budget and 2. from all over the county.
        While our team is based in Edison, NJ, we have many members that live all around the Middlesex County area, and
        it's hard for many to know exactly when a meeting, if even happening, is going to happen, and even harder for people
        to try and get rides for what can often be a 30+ minute journey one-way.
        <br><br>
        It's been hard, setting up attendance records for our team. In our early days, we weren't really aware of any
        good solution that could help us manage our hours, so our solution was a web app on our website that would send
        a discord message that you were present on this day. It was not a perfect solution, and a lot of people would
        either forget to open up the website, or would go to a different room before they filled out attendance.
        <br><br>
        It's been pretty hard getting people's records in place as well. Throughout the season, all we've had in terms
        of finance record-keeping, inventory, and resource management is a Google sheet. The google sheet isn't updated
        with the most recent information, and a lot of information gets lost in communication between phone calls or 
        the constant stream of messages that we have.
        <br><br>
        It's obvious there needs to be a better solution. A more connected solution. A solution that can manage all the
        problems our team has with coordination, while also maintaining a flexible system that allows for each team's 
        needs to be met. An application that coordinates attendance, carpooling, task management, announcement 
        propagating to people who might not check a social media platforms all that often, finances, inventory, roster,
        and to top it off, a team calendar, team specific resources, and the ability for team members to request 
        emails to be sent through the official team email.
        <br><br>
        If a solution like this does actually exist, I'm yet to find it (in which case please email me with that solution),
        but in the meanwhile, I'll take this into my own hands. My friend, Eli Nahoum, and I, will be working on this 
        application, and I will update on the progress of this app here.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Why'd you rip off The Blue Alliance's naming scheme?</h2>
        Because the most important alliance is the one formed within a team. That eliminated the name "The Red Alliance",
