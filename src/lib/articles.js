            So hello there! This is my first article on this blog. It's been a long time as well. I think during French
            class in 8th grade I started working on the design for this website. There's been so much I've learnt since
            then. I couldn't even begin to list the events that happened in the last 3 years. 
            <br><br>
            The most important thing I learnt, something that'll stick with me forever (I hope), is that you never
            achieve perfection on the first try. Some of the reasons why this website took so long is because I was so 
            obsessed with perfecting the exact design of this page. But you can only really learn from your mistakes
            if you aren't afraid to make them.
            <br><br>
            This website was originally going to be a full-stack website with every damn feature known to mankind 3
            years ago. But through the process of trying, failing, (procrastinating for months on end), and doing some
            research, I tempered my visions with a large dose of reality.
            <br><br>
            It wasn't until Hack Club did an event that I had the motivation to finish this website. At that point, I was
            concerned with looks but not perfection. I wanted to push something, to send out some sort of product. It wasn't
            by any means my best work, but it was a work I was able to push out there and get some feedback on. I used
            that feedback to make the website better, and used the rewards from that event to buy a domain.
            <br><br>
            Coming back to the point though, if you aim for something unrealistic, you'll land in development hell. When
            you set a realistic goal to push something you're proud of, you'll have a product that others can judge and
            give you feedback on. You'll have a product you yourself can introspect and change if you need to.
            <br><br>
            I hope to work on a lot of stuff in the coming future, and I hope for this blog to document all of it.
            And I hope you, the reader, enjoy the random introspections. Probably not this article, but all the others.

        description: "I had a talk with a friend about the different intricacies that turned music into sugar for the ears, " +
            "and I really just had to write about the beauty of it all.",

            I'm a Tamilian, so naturally I listen to a lot of Tamil music. Unfortunately, where I live, there aren't a 
            whole lot of Tamil people, and out of those Tamil people, there's even less that actually listen to Tamil
            music. Luckily, music transcends language. When you hear exceptionally well-made songs, every piece of the
            music stack comes together. The lyrics and the tune of the music come together to create sugar. And for
            people that don't understand the lyrics, the tune still has a real significance. 
            <br><br>
            One such song is "Thuli Thuli" from "Paiya". You might not know this song, but you can find it online. 
            You can see this during the chorus of the song. To understand it's impact, you have to understand the impact
            of the treble and bass on our emotions.
            <br><br>
            You hear bass in a lot of songs. It's especially useful in "feeling" words. Most of where the melody lies
            is in the middle of the music range, so outliers like bass add to the song without crowding the mid-area any
            more than it currently is.
            <br><br>
            What you may not notice as much, or at least I haven't, is that treble is used in this same manner. Higher
            notes that aren't in the vocal range can be as effective in "feeling" the music as bass can. And this is
            exactly what "Thuli Thuli" uses in the chorus.
            <br><br>
            The actual lyrics say (translated):
            <blockquote>
                "Go, go, go to her / my legs tell me to / Say, say, say to her / my heart begs me to"
            </blockquote>
            It's rhyme and effect are better in Tamil, but this will do. Compared to the first verse, the chorus includes
            a bassline and a widened instrument range in the mids (I think it's a piano playing two-sets of interval chords
            and a violin playing broken chords, but I might be wrong). But most importantly, on the second and fourth line,
            there's a treble synth of some sort that echoes throughout the line. The effect of that simple synth is a lot.
            It differentiates the line from the first and third, it adds a sense of intent to those lines. Combined with
            the lyrics (in Tamil), they make you feel like the character in this song has lost control, that he's going to
            go to her and tell her everything. 
            <br><br>
            It has a lot of effect in the slightly faster and slightly higher-pitched video version as well, if not more.
            Yuvan Shankar Raja, the composer of this movie's songs, did very well in its creation. While the big picture
            of a song matters, so do the small details. This single high note played in the treble had this big of
            an effect on the feeling of the song. 
            <br><br>
            There's also another song by Anirudh Ravichander: "Un Vizhigalil" from "Maan Karate". The beginning and the
            end of the song have the same lyrics. You can find them online, and I recommend listening to the entirety of
            the song. While the beginning and the end (only) have the same lyrics, the beat massively changes in between
            them.
            <br><br>
            This beat change is more than just more drums and some bassline and some violin all shuffled everywhere. The
            entirety of the song builds up to a point. The song's meaning is about a guy expressing his desire to remain
            with the girl he likes. And it builds up to that point. 
            <br><br>
            The beginning of the song is very basic. There's nothing more than a little bit of synth echo and the vocals.
            The violin then comes in for a solo, creating the theme of the melody of the song. A small guitar accompaniment
            and vocal part follow, and the chorus section comes. The chorus increases in speed, with a stronger guitar 
            accompaniment, a treble voice echo, and the "radio-like" repeating of words. Drums, the same violin tune, and
            a new guitar riff come to the midsection of the song. It later continues with a duet with the girl and the boy,
            the music continuing to intensity throughout the rest of the song. By the time the end comes, the lyrics stay
            the same but <b>the song has a completely different outlook</b>.
            <br><br>
            It goes from a solo from a guy who wants to stay with the girl he likes to a duet with a guy and a girl's love
            for each other welded together. The echo of the voices, the "radio-like" effects, the stereo-sound of each voice,
            it all has its own individual effect to create sweetness in the ears. You'd have to listen to the song to
            really get all these points, preferably with headphones to capture the intricacies, but it's all there. The
            smallest of effects to the music, the vocals, create such a difference in the feeling the song leaves you. The
            ending of the song is somewhat incomplete, as in it doesn't end with every instrument slowly coming to an end.
            The violin leaves one last movement before the song ends, as if the song is still playing elsewhere, and we've come
            to the end of our own listening session. It gives a feeling that the love these two share is going to stay.
            <br><br>
            All this is just for 2 songs as well. You could write so much more about just one of these songs, and imagine
            all the different songs out there in the world, each with embedded intricacies that all mix and merge together
            so well. The main tune, the main concept of a song matters as well. You can't really have a beautiful song if
            you just mash random notes. And you can have extremely basic songs with not a whole lot of intricacies that
            can still remain beautiful. But the exceptional songs, ones that are universally understood and felt without
            a language barrier, are songs that add the smallest changes, notes, and effects to really put someone in that
            feeling.
            <br><br>
            That's the beauty of music.
